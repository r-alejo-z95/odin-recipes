    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vintage lemonade is a refreshing and classic beverage that combines the tangy taste of freshly squeezed lemons with the sweetness of simple syrup, balanced by a touch of cold water.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 lemons</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ quarts water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Juice the 5 lemons to extract as much juice as possible, and set the juice aside.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the 1 ¼ cups of white sugar with 1 ¼ quarts of water. Heat over medium until the sugar is completely dissolved, creating a simple syrup. Allow the mixture to cool.</li>
        <li>In a large pitcher, mix the lemon juice with the cooled simple syrup. Stir well, then chill in the refrigerator. Serve over ice, garnished with lemon slices if desired.</li>
    </ol>
